This is a individual free project developed at the University of Aveiro, where the main goal was to handle requests from several APIs of my choosing, process that information and then build a website using React.js and Node.js that showed information from those APIs. In this website I used Tennis API and Youtube API and displayed some information about tennis players and also some videos about them. I also used Firebase and Firestore to handle login and registration processes and to store some data that would be shown in the web page and also that can be manipulated by users with some queries.
